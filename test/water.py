"""
This file is an animated water tile. It is created similarly to the brick,
but it only draws small solid squares, and it draws them to several textures.
In order to animate it, you have to call switchSurf. There is a 6 frame
timer in the Level file which controls that, at this point.

Probably should make this class into a general animator for tiles, but 
only animating water for now, and maybe forever.
